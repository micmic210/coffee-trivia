## Design 

### Color Scheme 
When designing the Coffee Trivia Quiz web application, careful consideration was given to the color scheme to enhance user experience and ensure readability. Here's an explanation of the color choices and their application:

#### Background and Decorative Elements
The background and decorative elements have soft, muted colors like beige and brown, evoking a cozy, coffee shop atmosphere. The intricate drawings of coffee items make them look sophisticated and charming without overwhelming the user. 

#### Interactive Elements
 1. Light Roast (Teal - #468787): The light roast option uses teal to stand out against the neutral background while maintaining a soothing appeal. Teal's calming properties make it an inviting choice for users. 
 2. Medium Roast (Red - #E38E84): The medium roast option is highlighted in soft red, associated with energy and alertness. This color contrasts with teal, making it easy to distinguish between choices. 
 3. Dark Roast (Dark Brown - #4A3933): The dark roast option uses deep brown, reflecting dark roast coffee's rich, intense nature. It harmonizes with the overall coffee theme and conveys robustness and depth. 
 4. French Roast (Chocolate Brown - #3B2C25): The French roast option is depicted in chocolate brown, slightly lighter than dark roast. This warm, inviting color fits the coffee-inspired pallet and creates a comforting feeling. 

 #### Feedback and Navigation
 - Correct Feedback (Teal Green - #468787)
 Correct answers are displayed in a teal green, a color associated with success and positive reinforcement. This shade maintains visual coherence and provides satisfying confirmation to users, enhancing their quiz experience. 
 - Incorrect Feedback (Red):
 Incorrect answers are displayed in bright red, drawing attention and indicating mistakes. Red's urgency effectively prompts users to consider their choices. 
 - Next and Play Again Buttons (Olive Green - #6E6555): 
 The "Next" button and "Play Again" buttons are in olive green, associated with progress and forward movement. This tone complements the earthy color scheme, maintaining visual harmony while guiding users through the quiz.

Its contemporary look complements the engaging nature of the quiz, making the text easy to read and visually appealing. The font's simplicity and elegance align with the coffee theme, providing a professional and enjoyable user experience.
